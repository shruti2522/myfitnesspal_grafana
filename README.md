MyFitnessPal is a mobile app used to track food & energy intake, exercise, and more. It supports CSV data export (e.g. through email) to facilitate archival, but this style is a bit antiquated for manual viewing.

A simple website that accepts CSV exports and renders nice visual representations using Grafana would be much better for users.
